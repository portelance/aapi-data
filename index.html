	<div class="copy intro"><div class="copy-p">Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are a rising population in America, estimated to reach 40 million by 2060.</div> <div class="copy-p">Encompassing East, South, Southeast Asian, Pacific Islanders, and those of multiracial Asian backgrounds, they represent one of the most socio-economically, culturally, and educationally disparate racial group in America.</div>
 <div class="copy-p">
Despite this intrinsic diversity and complexity, AAPI face a lack of critical, and nuanced representation in the media.</div>
 <div class="copy-p">
Most often, AAPI are portrayed through a monolithic cultural trope—overwhelmingly East Asian, highly educated, and socio-economically successful.</div>
 <div class="copy-p">
 This “Model Minority” myth is perceived innocuously, and in some cases, celebrated as the proof that the “American Dream” still exists in a time period of great economic and racial inequality.</div></div>

	<div class="copy race">Asian American Pacific Islanders are mostly depicted in major journal publication and media sources as being economically successful. This conclusion, however, is based on a decontextualized metric and a flawed abstraction. The supposed “economic success” and wellness” of AAPI is most often ascribed to “Aggregate Median Household Income.”</div>

	<div class="copy ethnicity">By simply disaggregating the data, we immediately see a breakdown of the suggestion that AAPI are uniformly better off economically.</div>

	<div class="copy size">Another factor that is largely disregarded in assumptions of socio-economic wellness made based on “Aggregate Median Household Income” is average family size. AAPIs typically have a larger household, meaning a greater number of wage earners and more family members to support on said income compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts.</div>

	<div class="copy percapita">When we take into account Average Household size, and depict per capita income (per individual), the supposed “model minority” advantage dissipates significantly.</div>

	<div class="copy outro"><div class="copy-p">The model minority myth, and the lack of awareness of the realities of Asian American Pacific Islanders has been a powerful tool in the arsenal of racial reactionaries that exploit the anxiety of working class Americans and weaken the movement for greater social justice by people of color. “If the Asians can do it, why can’t black, Latino, native or poor people do it too?” is a frequent rejoinder to calls for restorative affirmative action or reparations.</div><div class="copy-p">
 
We want to acknowledge that this simple infographic only scratches the surface of the social, economic and personal realities of AAPI (as well as those of other races). Yet we believe that beginning to debunk the myth that AAPI are uniformly socio-economically successful is vitally important to standing in intersectional solidarity with all people of color and economically oppressed people in America.</div>
