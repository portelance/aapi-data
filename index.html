	<div class="copy copy0">AAPI are a rising population in usa [...] 50 million by 2060. Asian Americans, encompassing East, South, Southeast Asian and Multiracial individuals and families, represent one of the most socio-economically, culturally, and educationally racial groups America.<br/><br/>
 
Despite this intrinsic diversity and complexity [Example of poverty rates of Cambodians vs Korean Americans], AAPI face a lack of critical, and nuanced representation in the media.<br/><br/>
 
Most often, AAPI are portrayed through an insidious monolithic cultural trope. AAPI  are depicted as overwhelmingly East Asian, highly educated, and uniformly socio-economically successful.<br/><br/>
 
 This “Model Minority” myth is perceived innocuously, and in some cases, celebrated as the proof that the “American Dream” still exists in a time period of great economic and racial inequality.</div>
	<div class="copy copy1">Asian American Pacific Islanders, (list ethnic groups?) are mostly depicted in major journal publication and media sources as economically successful. This conclusion is based on a decontextualized and flawed metric. The supposed “economic success” and “wellness” of AAPI is most often depicted using “Aggregate Median Household Income”</div>
	<div class="copy copy2">Yet, by simply disaggregating the data, we immediately see a breakdown of presumed uniformity and the subsequent suggestion that AAPI are “economically” better off. </div>
	<div class="copy copy3">When we depict per capita income (per individual), the supposed “model minority” advantage dissipates significantly.</div>
	<div class="copy copy4">The model minority myth, and the lack of awareness of the realities of AAPI has been a powerful tool in the arsenal of racial reactionaries that exploit the anxiety of working class Americans and weaken the movement for greater social justice by people of color. “If the Asians can do it, why can’t black, latino or poor folks do it too?” is the frequent rejoinder of the conservative media to the calls for affirmative action and the case for reparations.<br/><br/> 


We want to acknowledge that this simple infographic only scratches the surface of the social, economic and racial realities of AAPI- especially understanding the diaspora from a lens that seeks to stand in intersectional solidarity with all people of color and economically oppressed people in America.
